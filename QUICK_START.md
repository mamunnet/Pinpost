## 🆘 Something Wrong?

### "Can't access the website"

docker-compose ps
# If containers aren't running:
docker-compose up -d
```

### "MongoDB connection error"

1. Check if your MongoDB URL is correct:
   ```bash
   cat /root/Pinpost/.env
   ```
2. Make sure there are no spaces in the URL
3. Restart:
   ```bash
   cd /root/Pinpost && docker-compose restart
   ```

### "Containers keep restarting"

```bash
cd /root/Pinpost
docker-compose logs backend
# This shows the error - usually wrong MongoDB URL
```

```bash
cd /root/Pinpost
chmod -R 777 backend/uploads
docker-compose restart
```

### "Everything is broken!"

**Nuclear option** - Start completely fresh:

rm -rf Pinpost
git clone https://github.com/mamunnet/Pinpost.git
cd Pinpost
bash easy-deploy.sh
# Then enter your MongoDB URL again
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Save Your Info! 📝

Create a text file on your computer with:
- MongoDB connection string
- VPS IP address
- VPS root password
- Domain name (if you have one)

### 2. Use Browser Terminal

Hostinger's Browser Terminal is easier than SSH - no extra software needed!

### 3. Take Screenshots

When you change something, take a screenshot so you remember what you did!

### 4. Backup Weekly

Every week, run this:
```bash
cd /root/Pinpost
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz backend/uploads .env
```

### 5. Check Status Daily

Once a day, just check if it's running:
```bash
cd /root/Pinpost && docker-compose ps
```
