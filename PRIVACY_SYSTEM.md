# 🔒 Privacy System - Follow-Based Content Visibility

## 📋 Overview

Implemented a privacy system where **users can only see posts and blogs from people they follow** (plus their own content).

---

## 🎯 Privacy Rules

### **Content Visibility**

**You can see:**
- ✅ Your own posts and blogs
- ✅ Posts and blogs from users you follow
- ❌ Posts and blogs from users you don't follow

**Example:**
```
User A follows User B
User A does NOT follow User C

User A can see:
- Their own content ✅
- User B's content ✅
- User C's content ❌
```

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### **Backend Changes**

#### **1. Posts Endpoint** (`/api/posts`)
```python
@api_router.get("/posts")
async def get_posts(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 50, current_user_id: Optional[str] = Depends(get_optional_user)):
    if current_user_id:
        # Get following list
        following = await db.follows.find({"follower_id": current_user_id}).to_list(1000)
        following_ids = [f["following_id"] for f in following]
        
        # Show own posts + followed users' posts
        filter_query = {"author_id": {"$in": following_ids + [current_user_id]}}
    else:
        # Non-logged-in users see nothing
        filter_query = {"author_id": {"$in": []}}
```

**Privacy Logic:**
- ✅ Logged-in users: See own + followed users' posts
- ❌ Non-logged-in users: See nothing (privacy protection)

---

#### **2. Blogs Endpoint** (`/api/blogs`)
```python
@api_router.get("/blogs")
async def get_blogs(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 20, current_user_id: Optional[str] = Depends(get_optional_user)):
    if current_user_id:
        # Get following list
        following = await db.follows.find({"follower_id": current_user_id}).to_list(1000)
        following_ids = [f["following_id"] for f in following]
        
        # Show own blogs + followed users' blogs
        filter_query = {"author_id": {"$in": following_ids + [current_user_id]}}
    else:
        # Non-logged-in users see nothing
        filter_query = {"author_id": {"$in": []}}
```

**Privacy Logic:**
- ✅ Logged-in users: See own + followed users' blogs
- ❌ Non-logged-in users: See nothing

---

#### **3. Feed Endpoint** (`/api/feed`)
```python
@api_router.get("/feed")
async def get_feed(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 20, current_user_id: Optional[str] = Depends(get_optional_user)):
    if current_user_id:
        # Get following list
        following = await db.follows.find({"follower_id": current_user_id}).to_list(1000)
        following_ids = [f["following_id"] for f in following]
        
        # Show own content + followed users' content
        filter_query = {"author_id": {"$in": following_ids + [current_user_id]}}
    else:
        # Non-logged-in users see nothing
        filter_query = {"author_id": {"$in": []}}
    
    # Apply filter to both blogs and posts
    blogs = await db.blog_posts.find(filter_query).sort("created_at", -1).to_list(limit)
    posts = await db.short_posts.find(filter_query).sort("created_at", -1).to_list(limit)
```

**Privacy Logic:**
- ✅ Combined feed respects privacy
- ✅ Only shows content from followed users
- ✅ Always includes own content

## 📊 Affected Pages

### **Frontend Pages with Privacy**

**1. HomePage** (`/`)
- Shows feed from followed users only
- Empty if user follows no one
- Encourages following users

**2. SocialPage** (`/social`)
- All posts filtered by following
- "All Posts" tab shows followed users' posts
- "Following" tab shows same (redundant but consistent)

**3. BlogsPage** (`/blogs`)
- Only shows blogs from followed users
- Empty if user follows no one
- Encourages following content creators

**4. TrendingPage** (`/trending`)
- Trending posts from followed users only
- Trending blogs from followed users only
- Privacy-aware trending algorithm

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### **New User Flow**

**1. First Login:**
```
User logs in → No posts/blogs visible (follows no one)
↓
See "Who to Follow" suggestions
↓
Follow some users
↓
Content appears in feed!
```

**2. Empty State Messages:**
```
HomePage: "Follow some people to see their posts!"
SocialPage: "No posts yet. Follow users to see content."
BlogsPage: "No blogs available. Follow content creators!"
```

---

## 🔐 Security Benefits

### **Privacy Protection**

**1. Content Privacy** ✅
- Users must follow to see content
- No public browsing of posts/blogs
- Protects user privacy

**2. Relationship-Based Access** ✅
- Content visibility based on follow relationship
- Mutual consent (follow = permission to view)
- Social graph-based privacy

**3. No Anonymous Browsing** ✅
- Must be logged in to see any content
- Prevents scraping/crawling
- Protects user data

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Example Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: User A follows User B**
```
User A → Follows → User B

User A's feed shows:
- User A's own posts ✅
- User B's posts ✅
- User C's posts ❌ (not following)
```

#### **Scenario 2: User A follows nobody**
```
User A → Follows → Nobody

User A's feed shows:
- User A's own posts ✅
- No other posts ❌
- Empty state message
```

#### **Scenario 3: Non-logged-in user**
```
Anonymous User

Feed shows:
- Nothing ❌
- Redirect to login page
```

## 📝 Database Queries

### **Following Relationship**

**Collection:** `follows`
```javascript
{
  follower_id: "user_a_id",
  following_id: "user_b_id",
  created_at: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

**Query to get following list:**
```python
following = await db.follows.find({"follower_id": current_user_id}).to_list(1000)
following_ids = [f["following_id"] for f in following]
```

**Filter posts by following:**
```python
filter_query = {"author_id": {"$in": following_ids + [current_user_id]}}
posts = await db.short_posts.find(filter_query).sort("created_at", -1).to_list(limit)
```

GET /api/feed
# Response: [User A's posts, User B's posts]
```

```bash
# User A unfollows User B
DELETE /api/follow/{user_b_id}

# User A's feed should NOT show User B's posts
GET /api/feed
# Response: [User A's posts only]
```
