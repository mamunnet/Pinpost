# Issues Fixed! üéâ

## Root Causes Identified:

### 1. ‚ùå Frontend was pointing to REMOTE server, not LOCAL
**Problem:** Your `frontend/.env` had:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://penlink-social-1.preview.emergentagent.com
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
```

This means:
- All API calls were going to a remote server (not your local backend)
- The "user already exists" error was from the REMOTE database, not your local MongoDB
- The WebSocket was trying to connect to port 443 on localhost (which doesn't exist)

**Fixed:** Changed to:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. ‚ùå WebSocket Error from rrweb-recorder script
**Problem:** Third-party testing script was trying to connect to `ws://localhost:443/ws`

**Fixed:** Removed the problematic scripts from `index.html`:
- `rrweb.min.js`
- `rrweb-recorder-20250919-1.js`

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do Now:

### Step 1: Restart Frontend (REQUIRED)
The `.env` changes won't take effect until you restart. Stop your React app (Ctrl+C) and restart:
```powershell
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Start Backend (if not running)
Make sure your backend is running on port 8000:
```powershell
cd backend
python -m uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Step 3: Test Registration
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Try to register a new user
3. You should NOT see "user already exists" anymore (your local MongoDB is empty)
4. You should NOT see WebSocket errors

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works
Open browser console (F12) and check:
- ‚úÖ No WebSocket errors
- ‚úÖ API calls go to `http://localhost:8000/api/...`
- ‚úÖ Registration works
- ‚úÖ Login works

## Why Did This Happen?

You were likely testing on a preview/production environment before, and the `.env` file was configured for that remote server. When you tried to develop locally, your frontend was still talking to the remote server, which:
- Already had users registered (hence "user already exists")
- Was behind HTTPS (hence the 443 port for WebSocket)
- Required proper authentication (hence 401 errors)

## Your Local Setup Now:

```
Frontend (React)     Backend (FastAPI)     Database (MongoDB)
localhost:3000   ‚Üí   localhost:8000    ‚Üí   localhost:27017
     ‚úì                    ‚úì                     ‚úì
```

Everything should work locally now! üöÄ
