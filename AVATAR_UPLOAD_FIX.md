# Avatar Upload Fix - Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Broken Preview After Upload
**Problem:** After uploading a new avatar, the preview showed a broken image.

**Root Cause:**
- The component was mixing local blob URLs with server URLs
- No proper separation between preview URL and server path
- Missing proper URL construction using `getUserAvatarUrl`

**Fix:**
- Separated `previewUrl` (for display) and `avatarUrl` (for saving to DB)
- Used `getUserAvatarUrl` utility for consistent URL handling
- Proper handling of relative paths from server (/uploads/xxx.jpg)
- Added error handling with onError callback

### 2. No Way to Restore Original Photo
**Problem:** Users couldn't see or restore their existing profile picture after uploading a new one.

**Fix:**
- Added "Current Photo" badge showing existing avatar
- Added "Restore" button to revert to original photo
- Visual indication when changes are made (green "New" badge)
- Disabled "Save Changes" button until user makes actual changes

## ✨ New Features

### Current Photo Display
- Shows thumbnail of existing avatar at the top
- Clear visual indication of current vs new photo
- One-click restore to original

### Better Preview
- Immediate preview of uploaded image
- Proper error handling for broken images
- Visual "New" badge on changed photos
- No photo placeholder with icon and initial letter

### Improved UX
- Save button only enabled when changes are made
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Restore confirmation toast
- Better loading states

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### State Management
```javascript
const originalAvatar = user.avatar ? getUserAvatarUrl(user) : '';
const [avatarUrl, setAvatarUrl] = useState(originalAvatar);
const [previewUrl, setPreviewUrl] = useState(originalAvatar);
const [uploadedServerUrl, setUploadedServerUrl] = useState('');
const [hasChanges, setHasChanges] = useState(false);
```

**Why 3 URLs?**
- `originalAvatar`: User's existing photo (never changes)
- `previewUrl`: What user sees in preview (full URL for display)
- `avatarUrl`: What gets saved to DB (relative path like /uploads/xxx.jpg)

### Upload Flow
```
1. User selects file
   ↓
2. Create local blob URL → Set as previewUrl
   ↓
3. Upload to server → Get /uploads/xxx.jpg
   ↓
4. Store relative path in avatarUrl
   ↓
5. Update previewUrl with full URL (BACKEND_URL + /uploads/xxx.jpg)
   ↓
6. User clicks Save → Send relative path to API
```

### Restore Feature
```javascript
const handleRestoreOriginal = () => {
  if (originalAvatar) {
    setPreviewUrl(originalAvatar);
    setAvatarUrl(user.avatar || '');
    setUploadedServerUrl('');
    setPosition({ x: 0, y: 0 });
    setHasChanges(false);
    toast.success('Restored to original photo');
  }
};
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Upload new avatar → Preview shows correctly
- [x] Click Save → Avatar updates in profile
- [x] Refresh page → Avatar persists
- [x] Click Restore → Returns to original photo
- [x] Upload another photo → Can restore again
- [x] Remove photo → Avatar removed completely
- [x] No existing photo → Shows initial letter
- [x] Broken image URL → Shows error toast
- [x] Cancel → No changes saved
- [x] Drag to reposition → Position saved

## 🚀 How to Deploy

```powershell
# On local machine
cd D:\dev_project\Pinpost
git add frontend/src/components/EditAvatarModal.js
git commit -m "fix: avatar upload preview and add restore original feature"
git push origin main

# On production server
cd /docker/pinpost
git pull origin main
docker compose restart frontend
```

No rebuild needed! Since it's just JavaScript changes in the component, a simple restart will pick up the new code from the built bundle (assuming you rebuild).

Actually, for React changes, you DO need to rebuild:

```bash
# On production server
cd /docker/pinpost
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache frontend
docker compose up -d
```
